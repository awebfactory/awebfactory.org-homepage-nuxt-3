## Code as single source of truth

Learning process: Clone the repo and follow the commits step by step. Run in dev mode and compare what you are seeing happen with the code and the changes for each commit. We try to make them as atomic as possible.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/awebfactory/awebfactory.org-homepage-nuxt-3.git
cd awebfactory.org-homepage-nuxt-3
npm install
npm run dev
```
